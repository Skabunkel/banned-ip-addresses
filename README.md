# 1692122098 

As of above epoch this repos is archived since i have moved my junk of the old centos server running this fail to ban script.
The replacement has no need for this since it is not running a public SSH service.


# banned-ip-addresses
A list of ip addresses banned by fail2ban on my server.

They keep showing up all i can do is ban them and add them to the list, what do you want from me?
